The companion that leads the conversation wears a crown and a screen-reader-only *Lead*, wherever the filtering leaves it in the list. A row whose companion the draft already names carries the count of those mentions before the crown, given by the host as data. It draws only: reading the arobase in the draft, owning `open` and `query`, and writing the mention back into the text all belong to the host. ArrowUp/ArrowDown travel and wrap, Enter and Tab select, Escape or a press outside dismisses, and a query matching no companion renders no menu at all.
