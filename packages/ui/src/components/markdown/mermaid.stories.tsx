Colours are baked into the SVG, so the diagram is redrawn when the theme under it changes, read from the host itself rather than from the document: two themes side by side each get their own. Mermaid ships a stylesheet with every diagram, prefixed selectors and unprefixed keyframes alike, so the drawing goes into a shadow root — its CSS reaches this diagram and nothing else, while the tokens and the type it inherits still cross the boundary.",
