# Smoke checklist — real Claude Code

Run before tagging a release. Every step here exercises something the automated
suite cannot reach: a signed-in binary, the network, a packaged bundle, or the
macOS quit sequence.

## Preconditions

- A real `claude` on `PATH`, signed in. Check with `claude --version`.
- `unset KIROSHI_CLAUDE_BIN`. A leftover export from an E2E session silently
  points the live tests and the app at the fake binary, and everything below
  passes against a stub that never talks to the network.
- Quit any running `bun run dev` first. `tauri.dev.conf.json` overrides only
  `bundle.icon`, so the identifier, the single-instance lock and the data
  directory are shared with the packaged app — the two builds fight over both.
- Store paths, both under `~/Library/Application Support/com.kiroshi.app/`:
  `conversations.sqlite3` holds the transcript the app reads and writes, and
  `session.json` is the legacy file the first launch imports once and never
  writes again.

## Signing

`bun run tauri:build` on its own ad-hoc signs the bundle. To sign it with the
Developer ID, put the identity in the environment:

```
APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Steve Puget (BBE5V2JL5H)" bun run tauri:build
```

The identity stays out of the committed config on purpose: a personal
certificate name is not shared property. Tauri reads `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`,
enables the hardened runtime on its own, and signs every nested executable —
`kiroshi-agent` and `kiroshi-claude` first, then `kiroshi-app`, then the
bundle. Confirm both:

```
APP=apps/app/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/Kiroshi.app
codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=4 "$APP"
codesign -d --verbose=4 "$APP" 2>&1 | grep -E "flags|Authority"
```

→ `valid on disk`, `flags=0x10000(runtime)`, and an `Authority` chain ending at
`Apple Root CA`. Anything else and the bundle is not signed with the Developer
ID, whatever the build log claimed.

`--deep` covers the nested executables, but not what the hardened runtime does
to them. Check them on their own:

```
AGENT="$APP/Contents/MacOS/kiroshi-agent"
codesign -dv "$AGENT" 2>&1 | grep -E "Identifier|TeamIdentifier"
codesign -dv "$APP/Contents/MacOS/kiroshi-claude" 2>&1 | grep -E "Identifier|TeamIdentifier"
"$AGENT" --probe
```

→ `Identifier=kiroshi-agent` with a `TeamIdentifier`, a `TeamIdentifier` on
`kiroshi-claude` too, then one line of JSON. A probe that names a path instead
means the provider executable did not land beside the sidecar.
`Identifier=a.out` and no team means the binary kept the ad hoc signature bun
gives it, which Apple will not notarize. A `SharedArrayBuffer is not defined`
crash means `bundle.macOS.entitlements` lost `com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit`,
which the hardened runtime needs to leave the JavaScriptCore JIT enabled — a
failure that only ever shows up in a signed build, never in `bun run dev`.

**Signing is not notarization.** A signed bundle is still refused by Gatekeeper:
`spctl --assess --type execute "$APP"` answers
`rejected / source=Unnotarized Developer ID` until the bundle has been submitted
to Apple and stapled. That is a separate step run outside this checklist, and no
notarization credential belongs in the repo.

## Steps

1. `bun run --filter app test:live`
   → the four `#[ignore]`d live tests pass.

2. Build signed (see **Signing** above), then
   `ls apps/app/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/Kiroshi.app/Contents/MacOS/`
   → **exactly** `kiroshi-app`, `kiroshi-agent` and `kiroshi-claude`.
   `fake_claude` next to them means the feature gate regressed.

3. Open the `.dmg` from
   `apps/app/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/`, drag to `/Applications`,
   launch.
   → first launch needs right-click → Open: the bundle is not notarized, so
   Gatekeeper refuses a double-click whether it is ad-hoc or Developer ID
   signed. On a Mac that received the `.dmg` over the network, the fix is
   `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Kiroshi.app`.

4. Read the header.
   → the real CLI version is shown and the status dot is ready. A missing
   version means the app resolved no binary.

5. Send `Remember the number 4271.`
   → the reply streams in token by token, not as one block.

6. Ask it to write a file, e.g. `Write "hello" to /tmp/kiroshi-smoke.txt`.
   → a permission card appears; Allow once; the activity row turns green.

7. Send a long prompt (`Count from 1 to 300, one number per line.`) and press
   Stop mid-stream.
   → the turn ends cancelled and the composer is usable again.

8. Cmd+Q, then `pgrep -fl claude`.
   → prints nothing. **This is the only check that covers the `RunEvent::Exit`
   wiring.** No automated test can reach it: the suite runs under `MockRuntime`,
   which never emits `RunEvent::Exit`, so the whole `terminate_session` path on
   quit is unverified until this step runs.

9. Relaunch.
   → every message of the session above is back, read from
   `conversations.sqlite3`, in order and each exactly once — including the
   stopped reply from step 7, which comes back stopped rather than as a message
   still being written. Ask `What number did I ask you to remember?`
   → the bot **does** know, and nothing about the transcript moves while it
   answers: no message is repeated, hidden or reordered, and the question
   appears once. The Claude session that heard the number is gone — this launch
   started a fresh one — and what it is answering from is the conversation
   rebuilt out of `conversations.sqlite3` and carried in its first prompt.

10. Send `Count from 1 to 500, one number per line.` and quit with Cmd+Q while
    it is still streaming, then relaunch.
    → the partial reply is there with the words it had reached, marked stopped.
    Nothing is left looking like a message still being written.

11. Scroll to the top of a transcript longer than 20 messages.
    → `Load older messages` appears; use it — with the keyboard as well as the
    mouse. The page lands above the reader without moving the row they were
    looking at, the control keeps focus while it loads, and once the beginning
    is reached it is replaced by `Beginning of the conversation`. No message
    appears twice and none is skipped.

12. Quit, then `echo '{' > ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.kiroshi.app/session.json`
    and relaunch.
    → the transcript is unchanged and there is no crash: nothing reads that file
    any more once the import has run, and the import never destroys bytes it
    cannot parse.

## Orphan-group check

Run before quitting, then again after. The second run must print nothing but
the header.

```
APP_PID=$(pgrep -x Kiroshi); CLAUDE=$(pgrep -P "$APP_PID" -f claude)
PGID=$(ps -o pgid= -p "$CLAUDE" | tr -d ' ')
ps -o pid=,ppid=,pgid=,command= -g "$PGID"
```

Repeat the pair for each way out of the app:

- Cmd+Q
- the red close button
- Force Quit from Activity Monitor

## Known limitations

- Every UI check here is manual because nothing automates it: `e2e_session.rs`
  stops at the Tauri command layer and never mounts React, and `tauri-driver`
  has no macOS support — WKWebView exposes no WebDriver endpoint.
- `kill -9` on the app leaves the process group behind. `SIGKILL` is
  uncatchable, so no handler runs — this is not a failure of the shutdown path.
- A WKWebView content-process crash is not covered. Tauri v2 exposes no portable
  hook for it.
- Real Claude Code **mints a new session id on `--resume`**, so the id a restart
  within one launch carries is legitimately a different one. That is the resume
  chain working, not a bug — the check is that the answer carries on, never that
  the id is stable.
- A **relaunch rebuilds the model's context rather than resuming it**: Claude is
  started fresh, and the first prompt of every run it never answered in carries
  the conversation reconstructed from the database — the bot's instructions and
  memory, the summary of what was folded away, the messages since it, an older
  message the prompt explicitly answers, and the prompt. Step 9 asserts that as
  the behaviour it is, so that whoever changes it has to change the checklist
  too.
- The reconstruction is **bounded**, so a conversation far longer than step 5's
  will not come back word for word: only the most recent stretch does, and
  everything before it through the summary a checkpoint folded. What a long chat
  loses in detail is expected, not a failure of the recovery.
- **Rotation is invisible by design and has no control of its own**, so nothing
  here drives one on purpose. It happens under the reader — at the preventive
  threshold, or once a provider session is refused or stops answering — and the
  only thing to check is what step 9 checks: the chat carries on and the
  transcript does not move.
