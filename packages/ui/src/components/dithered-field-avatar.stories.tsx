Every companion shares one screen: each cell is a square of one fixed size, its tone carried by opacity in two steps through error diffusion, so the tile reads in three tones of one hue. The density field is the companion's ASCII glyph silhouette, blurred, over a seeded low noise floor, all seeded on the name. The grid holds the same cell count at every size.
