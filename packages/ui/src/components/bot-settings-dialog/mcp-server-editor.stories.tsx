The fields and the JSON are two readings of one thing: a field answered is carried into the text, the text edited is carried back into the fields, and every key no field names is kept untouched, because the shape belongs to the transport. Which fields stand under Connection is the transport's own answer — a command and its arguments for a server started here, an address and its headers for one reached over the network.
