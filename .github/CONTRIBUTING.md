# Contributing to Kiroshi

Thanks for taking the time. Kiroshi is a Tauri desktop app in a Bun monorepo:
`apps/app` composes screens and owns the logic, `packages/ui` owns every visual.

## Conventions

**[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) is the single source of truth** for how code is
written here — the SIMPLE principles, the UI/app boundary, naming, file layout,
commit format, and the safety rules. Read it before your first change and follow
it; this file only covers the mechanics of getting a change in. Where the two
disagree, `AGENTS.md` wins.

Two rules from it are worth repeating, because they are the ones pull requests
trip over:

- **No visual code in `apps/app`.** A raw HTML element, a Tailwind class, or any
  markup that is not already a `@workspace/ui` component belongs in
  `packages/ui`, with a Storybook story. A component without a story is not done.
- **No new dependencies without approval.** Open an issue first and say what the
  package buys us.

## Getting set up

```bash
bun install
bun run dev        # Tauri app: Vite dev server + native window
bun run storybook  # Storybook on :6006 — the place to build UI
```

You need [Bun](https://bun.sh) and the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs). On
Linux, install the
[Tauri system dependencies](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/#linux). The
test suite drives headless Chromium: run `bunx playwright install chromium` once
from `packages/ui`.

Running the app locally launches a real Claude Code CLI on your machine. Read
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) so you know what that means before you approve tool
calls from a branch you are reviewing.

## Making a change

1. Open an issue first for anything beyond a small fix, so the approach can be
   agreed before you write it. Bugs and features each have a form.
2. Branch off `main`. Never push to `main`.
3. Keep the change surgical — one concern per commit, and every changed line
   traceable to the request.
4. Write commits as [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org):
   `feat(ui): …`, `fix(app): …`, `chore: …`.

## Before you open a pull request

```bash
bun run lint    # Biome
bun run types   # tsc -b
bun run test    # Vitest + cargo test
```

All three must pass. Then fill in the pull request template: say what changed
and why, and how a reviewer can see it working. Screenshots or a short capture
for anything visual.

Before tagging a release, the manual checks in
[`apps/app/SMOKE.md`](../apps/app/SMOKE.md) cover what the automated suite cannot
reach.

## Reporting problems

- **Bug or feature request** — use the issue forms in the repository's Issues
  tab.
- **Security vulnerability** — do not open an issue. Follow
  [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
- **Conduct** — see [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which applies to
  every space in this project.
