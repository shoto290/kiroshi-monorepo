Every author goes through the same allowlist: raw HTML is never turned into nodes and reads as the source text it was written with, `script`, `style` and `iframe` included, while `on*` attributes and `javascript:` URLs are dropped from everything markdown itself produced, so user prose and agent prose are equally safe. Typography comes from the prose class this module owns, which MessageBubbleContent also applies, so a block reads the same inside or outside a bubble. A fenced block goes through the bundled highlighter and carries its own copy control, and a table is framed, scrollable and copyable through `markdown/table.tsx`. Links are read as destinations, never as text: every web link opens outside the app with no referrer and carries the host taken from its href alone, a fragment stays in the answer, a scheme the app cannot open renders as plain text, and a long link is clipped at the bubble width rather than widening it — its destination the last thing to go. Math and diagrams are the two blocks that need code this renderer does not carry: `$…$`, `$$…$$` and a `mermaid` fence each fetch their renderer the first time a document holds one, keep the source on screen until it lands, and keep that same source when it cannot be parsed.",

Showing the source is not relaxing anything: the parser still never builds a node from HTML, and the allowlist behind it is unchanged. The diagram is the one place markup is injected rather than built from the tree, so mermaid draws it under its strict level: the script and the event handlers are gone by the time the SVG reaches the DOM, and what a label may still carry is what the allowlist already grants ordinary markdown — an element, never a handler on it. The play proves the three ways this could fail: no script ran, no rule applied — a surviving `style` would hide the block — and no request was attempted.",
