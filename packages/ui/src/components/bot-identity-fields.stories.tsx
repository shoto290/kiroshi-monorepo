Nothing is behind a popover, a disclosure or a tab set — a reader in a companion's appearance sees every choice at once and compares them instead of opening one to find out. Each grid is a real radio group, so arrow keys move within it and the current choice is announced; the ring is the same answer for the eye. Every thumbnail wears the animal, the blot and the id currently in play, so both rows preview the actual outcome. Picking an animal or a blot takes the picture off, because the picture is what wins over both. The block never reads a file: it hands the host a `File` and waits for the picture to come back as `identity.image`. Only the preview is allowed to move, and only while `working` — the choices always rest.",
