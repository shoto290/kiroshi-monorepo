The colour grid is a real radio group, so arrow keys move within it and the current choice is announced. Every swatch wears the companion's own glyph, so the row previews the actual outcome. Picking a colour takes the picture off, because the picture wins over it. The block never reads a file: it hands the host a `File` and waits for the picture to come back as `identity.image`. Only the preview moves, and only while `working`; the swatches always rest.",
