There is deliberately no `Always allow`, because persisting a rule means echoing a `localSettings` suggestion into `updatedPermissions`, which writes to `.claude/settings.local.json` and is out of scope for V0.1. `apps/app/src/components/thread-prompt.tsx:38` is the only caller: it names the tool, hands over the title the request carries, and leaves the status on its pending default.',
