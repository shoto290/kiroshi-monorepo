The transcript carries a mention as `<@bot-id>` in the text and this is what that id becomes: a chip in the flow of the sentence, avatar and name together, tinted from the colour it inherits so it reads the same in a bot's bubble and in the reader's own. The id is resolved against the bots the conversation holds — `RosterProvider` names them once around the transcript, so nothing threads a roster down to each message. An id the conversation does not know still draws a chip rather than leaking the raw `<@…>` at the reader: a silhouette and *Unknown bot*, which is what a mention of a bot that left looks like. The name truncates instead of pushing the line, and the avatar is hidden from screen readers so the mention is announced as the name alone. `Markdown` does the parsing, so a mention written inside code stays literal.",
