It says the app is starting and nothing more — no spinner, no progress bar, no product name, no way out — so a host mounts it for exactly as long as its first read is in flight and swaps it for the shell the answer calls for. The mark alone carries the message, so when the reader asks for reduced motion and the mark stops moving, the status string is drawn under it instead of being left to screen readers. Reach for it on launch, never for a read a reader triggered: a refresh inside the app belongs to a skeleton where the data will land, not to a screen that takes the window back.",

Turn reduced motion on at the system level and the status string appears under the still mark; the test context runs reduced, so this play covers the string in both forms.",
