# Agent sidecar — the protocol the host speaks

Every conversation turn goes through the sidecar (`apps/app/sidecar`), a single
compiled Bun binary carrying its provider's own agent SDK. The host never spawns
an agent itself: it spawns the sidecar, and the sidecar decides how its provider
is spelled. Nothing below names a CLI flag, because the host no longer sets any —
a second provider is one more module inside the sidecar.

The host resolves no executable of its own. Its connection state and its model
catalogue are both asked of the sidecar, so nothing here reads a `PATH`.

## Process shape

```
kiroshi-agent --serve [--provider=<id>]
```

**One process for every session.** stdin is NDJSON commands from the host, stdout
is NDJSON frames back, stderr is a separate pipe the host drains and discards. A
session is a lane on that one pipe, opened and closed by command, and the process
outlives every one of them.

## Handshake

The sidecar's first stdout line, before any session exists:

```json
{"type":"ready","provider":"<id>","version":"2.1.237","sdkVersion":"0.3.237",
 "capabilities":["partialMessages","resume","interactivePermissions","modelCatalogue",
 "toolCatalogue"]}
```

Same payload `--probe` prints. `capabilities` is a contract, not a description:
what the sidecar does not announce, the host does not ask for — a build that
names no `partialMessages` is opened with `includePartialMessages: false`, and
the reader sees whole messages instead of a stream that would never arrive.

A sidecar that never announces itself surfaces as `startupTimeout`; one that dies
first, as `crashed`.

## Host → sidecar

Three commands name no session, because they are about the install rather than
about a conversation. Each is asked once per launch and cached by the host.

Each is answered under the type it was asked, so one name stands for the ask and
its answer both.

| `type` | Answered with | Becomes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `check` | `{"type":"check","authenticated":bool,"detail"?:string}` | the `CheckReport` |
| `models` | `{"type":"models","models":[…]}` | the model catalogue |
| `tools` | `{"type":"tools","tools":[…]}` | the tool catalogue |

`check` reads the provider's own credential store; `detail` says the question
could not be answered at all, which reaches the frontend as `authCheckFailed`
rather than as `notAuthenticated`. `models` is `Query.supportedModels()`, asked of
a session opened for nothing else and closed again — there is no file to read and
no endpoint to ask.

`tools` is the `tools` of the `init` frame, taken off a session opened for nothing
else and closed the moment the frame lands. No control request answers it, and the
frame is only emitted once a turn has begun — so unlike `models` the ask costs a
turn that is started and never finished. What an MCP server provides is filtered
out before the answer is written: those tools belong to a server rather than to
the install.

Every other command names its session.

| `type` | Carries | Becomes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `open` | `cwd`, `resume?`, `pluginPath?`, `systemPluginPath?`, `userPluginPath?`, `agent?`, `identity?`, `outputStyle?`, `settingsPath?`, `partialMessages`, `env?`, `outputSchema?` | `query()` options |
| `prompt` | `text` | one `SDKUserMessage` on the session's prompt stream |
| `interrupt` | — | `Query.interrupt()` |
| `permission` | `requestId`, `decision` | the `canUseTool` promise's answer |
| `host_response` | `requestId`, `result` or `error` | the `askHost` promise's answer |
| `close` | — | the prompt stream ends and `Query.close()` runs |

`open` maps to SDK options directly:

- `outputSchema` is the JSON schema a caller wants the turn's answer shaped by. It
  reaches the SDK as `outputFormat: { type: "json_schema", schema }` and is read by
  nothing on the way: a session opened without one asks for no `outputFormat` at all.
- `resume` is the SDK's `resume`. The stored id is tried first; a refusal falls
  back to a fresh session and the id is given up on only when the refusal was a
  crash — see `commands.rs::start_with_fallback`.
- `pluginPath` is the bot's own plugin bundle, loaded for the session and never
  installed, and `agent` is the agent inside it the main thread is promoted to,
  namespaced as `<plugin>:<agent>` so it cannot resolve to one of the reader's own.
  What the bot was told is that agent's body — see `PLUGINS.md` for what was
  measured, and `bundles.rs` for what is written. Both are re-sent on every spawn,
  a resume included: neither is carried across one.
- `systemPluginPath` is the app's own plugin bundle, loaded beside the bot's for the
  same session and never promoted — nothing in it is an agent. Measured on 2.1.239,
  two local plugins load together and each namespaces its own skills. It is passed
  second, after the bot's, and only carried when a `pluginPath` is: a session with no
  bot bundle loads no plugin at all. Its `.mcp.json` servers are bridged the same way
  the bot's are, with the bot's names winning a clash.
- `userPluginPath` is the person's own plugin bundle, laid down once and owned by them,
  loaded third beside the other two and never promoted. Its `.mcp.json` is not read: the
  person's plugin declares no server. Its preloaded skills ride the layer like the app's,
  above the sentence naming the bot's directory.
- the provider's own preset system prompt stays set on every spawn that names an
  `agent`. Measured, not documented: without it the agent resolves and its body is
  never applied. Its `append` is the Kiroshi layer, the same text on every session:
  the speaking situation of a chat, no capability and no tool name, so an exported
  bot loses the chat and nothing else. It is not editable by anyone. A spawn carrying
  a `pluginPath` appends one more sentence, naming that directory as where the bot's
  own skills live — with two plugins loaded, nothing else says which is the bot's.
- `identity` is who the bot is: the host's own sentences over the bot's own name and
  title, rendered on the host side — see `bundles.rs::identity`. It is appended to the
  layer above the Kiroshi sentences, and it travels on the request rather than in the
  bundle because the sentences are the app's: no bot's file carries a copy, and a
  rename reaches the next session with nothing rewritten. Left out for a session
  opened with no bot to name, which is a session that carries no plugin either.
- `outputStyle` is the style the answer is written in, by the name the provider knows
  it under (`Concise`…). Named, it is passed as `settings: { outputStyle }` — an
  inline settings object, since `settingSources: []` closes every settings file on the
  machine. Left out, no `settings` key is passed at all.
- `settingsPath` is the `settings.json` lying at the root of the bot's own bundle, sent
  only when the file is there — see `bundles.rs::settings_file`. The sidecar reads it and
  keeps `permissions.allow`, `permissions.ask`, `permissions.deny`,
  `permissions.defaultMode` and `outputStyle`; every other key is dropped —
  `permissions.additionalDirectories` among them, since a bot widening its own reach is
  the thing the floor exists to prevent — `disableBypassPermissionsMode` is forced to
  `disable`, and a `defaultMode` of `bypassPermissions` is refused. What is kept becomes
  the inline `settings` object and `permissionMode` becomes the declared `defaultMode` or
  `auto`. A file the bot's own settings name wins over `outputStyle` on the request. Unreadable or not a JSON object, the session opens
  without it. Anything refused — the file itself, a `bypassPermissions` mode, or a key outside
  the allowlist, named — rides a `settings_rejected` frame to the reader's notice.
  `disableBypassPermissionsMode` is forced to `disable` even for a bot carrying no file at all,
  and `settingSources: []` stays set either way: this is the only settings file a session reads.
- `appDataDir` is the directory the host keeps its own data in, sent when the host knows
  it. The sidecar never reads it: it hands it to the security floor, which the session
  carries as `managedSettings`, the policy tier a bot's own settings cannot loosen. The
  floor denies reading `conversations.sqlite3` and its `-wal`/`-shm` companions,
  `kiroshi.db`, every `session.json*` and the `attachments` directory — at the
  permission layer and in `sandbox.filesystem.denyRead` both. It keeps `bots` and
  `spaces` in `sandbox.filesystem.denyRead`, lists the session's own plugin paths in
  `allowRead`, and denies the `Read` tool on every other bundle it finds under
  `bots/plugins` and `spaces`. Left out, the rest of the floor still applies: the home
  credential paths, the environment files and the sandbox itself.
- `env` is the SDK's `env`: variables for the agent this session runs, not for
  the sidecar.
- `serverEnv` is what the environment store serves this bot's MCP servers, read once
  when the session opens: `base`, the space scope under the bot scope, and `perServer`,
  one overlay per server name holding that server's own scope — the narrowest
  definition winning. The sidecar expands `${VAR}` and `${VAR:-default}` in the
  `command`, `args`, `env`, `url` and `headers` of every server the bundle declares; a
  declaration holding no `${` is handed over untouched. A variable with neither value
  nor default leaves its server out of the options and rides a `server_env_rejected`
  frame naming the server and the variable. `failure`, set when the store could not be
  read, leaves out every server declaring a variable and rides the same frame. A server
  the options did keep is read once the session is initialized, for the 5000 ms of the
  poll budget. What that budget settles rides the frames of the first prompt: a server it
  read `needs-auth` as waiting for its authorization, one it left pending as still
  connecting after the time the read spent, worded as connecting and not as left out, the
  CLI still dialling it and its tools able to land later in the session, which the section
  handed to the bot says in its own words. A line never counts connection attempts: the
  CLI retries a failing server on its own, several times per read, so no number the
  sidecar could state would be true. A server the budget read failed earns one
  reconnection, taken after the budget so no prompt waits on it, and one frame of its own:
  the reconnection's answer when it threw, and that the server was reconnected and holds
  its tools again when it did not, which the section says in its own words too. A server
  the budget left pending is watched past it, one status call every second, until it reads
  connected, failed or `needs-auth`, or 60000 ms pass and it rides a stderr line instead.
  Connected, it draws nothing; failed, it earns the same one reconnection and frame;
  `needs-auth`, it earns that frame. One frame per server at the most after the budget,
  and none once the session closed. A frame raised after a prompt was handed rides the
  next prompt's section, so the bot reads what the screen reads. A slash command is handed
  over untouched, its line waiting for the next prompt that is not one; a line is framed
  once, whichever prompt ends up carrying it. The section itself follows what its lines
  say: it claims a server was left out only when one was, and tells the bot where a server
  still connecting or freshly reconnected stands. A status read carries a
  name and a status alone, so that reason is built from the status the last read named,
  the time the read had spent, and the message the reconnection threw, and from nothing
  else: the cause the CLI knows, a 401 or a refused socket, never crosses the control
  protocol. That frame goes out in the very call
  that hands the prompt carrying the same line over, once per session, so the notice
  lands while a turn is live. The frames raised after the budget go out at once, and their
  lines wait for the next prompt. The session opens without waiting on any of it: the
  `opened` frame goes out first and the prompts wait behind the budget, in the order they
  were received, never longer than it. No deadline covers that read as a whole: each status
  call taken while polling is bounded by what is left of the 5000 ms poll budget, and the
  reconnections and the call taken after them by 30000 ms each, what the CLI gives an MCP
  request of its own. The polls stop once the time left, taken from a clock and not
  counted in sleeps, no longer covers a 250 ms wait and a call after it, so the last call
  of a read is always given a bound it can land in. No session option bounds the
  dial: neither `MCP_TIMEOUT` nor `MCP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS` is set, the CLI keeping its
  own defaults. A status call that outlasts
  its bound ends the polls there and keeps what the earlier calls named: only the very
  first call has nothing to fall back on, and it ends the read on a stderr line with
  nothing reported. The call taken after the reconnections is the same: outlasting, it
  leaves the servers the earlier calls left unconnected reported, and rides a stderr line
  of its own. A stderr line names only the servers the read holds no status for: one the
  earlier calls already named is reported, not given up on, and a give up naming no server
  is not written. The call taken after the reconnections is the exception: outlasting, it
  names on stderr every server the read reconnected, those lines being the only trace it
  left. A server no status call has named yet is polled for 1000 ms only, then
  left to the stderr line. An interrupt drops what is held and leaves
  the read running: the CLI never received that prompt, so no interrupt is sent to it and
  the sidecar rides a `result` frame of subtype `interrupted` instead, which ends the
  host's turn as cancelled. An interrupt with nothing held reaches the CLI as before. A
  close abandons the read, frame, stderr line and timers included. A server
  reading `needs-auth` is named as waiting for its authorization, and no reconnection is
  attempted on it. A server no read ever named rides no frame: the sidecar writes one
  stderr line naming it, as it does when the read throws or outlasts its deadline. No
  resolved value is ever named in a frame or a log line: the message a reconnection
  throws is cut at 300 characters and every value of eight characters or more the store
  holds reads `[redacted]` in it.

## Sidecar → host

Every line is an envelope:

```json
{"session":"<key>","frame":{…}}
```

The frame is an `SDKMessage` verbatim, plus the four the sidecar adds itself.

| `frame.type` | Source | Mapped to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `opened` | the sidecar, once `initializationResult()` returns | the start's readiness gate |
| `closed` | the sidecar, when the query ends or throws | `crashed` |
| `system` / `init` | `SDKSystemMessage` — `session_id` | `sessionReady` |
| `commands` | the sidecar, from `initializationResult().commands` | `commandsListed` (only when the frame names one) |
| `stream_event` | `SDKPartialAssistantMessage` — one Messages API streaming event | `messageStarted` / `messageDelta` / `activity` |
| `assistant` | `SDKAssistantMessage` — `text` and/or `tool_use` blocks | `messageCompleted` / `activity` |
| `user` | `SDKUserMessage` — `tool_result` with `is_error` | `activity` (succeeded / failed) |
| `result` | `SDKResultMessage` — `subtype`, `session_id`, `is_error`, or the sidecar when a stop lands on a prompt still held | `turnEnded` |
| `host_request` | the sidecar, from `askHost` | nothing — it is answered, not read |
| `control_request` / `can_use_tool` | the sidecar, from `canUseTool` | `permissionRequested` |
| `control_request` / `can_use_tool`, tool `AskUserQuestion` | the sidecar, from `canUseTool` | `questionRequested` |
| `settings_rejected` | the sidecar, when the bot's `settings.json` is refused in part or in whole | `failed` — `settingsRejected`, the frame's `detail` as its reason |
| `server_env_rejected` | the sidecar, when a declared MCP server is left out for want of a variable, or when a kept server has not connected | `failed` — `serverEnvRejected`, raised as a non terminal notice reading the frame's `detail` and telling the reader the conversation carries on with the other servers |

Every other `SDKMessage` type is dropped: `translate.rs` reads what the contract
needs and nothing else, so a new SDK message is inert until it is asked for.

## Permissions

`canUseTool` is a promise the SDK blocks the tool on. The sidecar answers it out
of band: it emits the request under the SDK's own `requestId`, and the host's
`permission` command resolves it.

```json
{"type":"permission","session":"…","requestId":"…",
 "decision":{"behavior":"allow","updatedInput":{…}}}
```

`AskUserQuestion` is the same ask read differently: it travels as
`questionRequested` and is answered by allowing the tool with the reader's
replies written into its input, keyed by the question they answer.

```json
{"type":"permission","session":"…","requestId":"…",
 "decision":{"behavior":"allow","updatedInput":{"questions":[…],"answers":{"Which library?":"date-fns"}}}}
```

`{"behavior":"deny","message":"…"}` produces a `tool_result` with `is_error:
true` and the turn continues. A session closing settles every promise it still
holds as a denial: an unanswered one would block its tool forever, since a
permission prompt has no deadline of its own.

## Host requests

`canUseTool` asks the reader; `host_request` asks the host itself. The sidecar
emits it under a `requestId` it owns, and the host answers with exactly one
`host_response` carrying that same id, either a `result` or an `error`.

```json
{"session":"…","frame":{"type":"host_request","requestId":"…",
 "request":{"subtype":"routine","operation":"create","payload":{…}}}}
```

```json
{"type":"host_response","session":"…","requestId":"…","result":{…}}
{"type":"host_response","session":"…","requestId":"…","error":{"kind":"routineOfAnotherBot","id":"…","botId":"…"}}
```

A `host_request` never reaches the translator: it raises no `AgentEvent`, it ends
no turn, and it does not promote a session to `Running`.

`subtype` names who serves the request. `routine` is served by
`routines::host::RoutineHost`, over the six operations `list`, `triggerSources`,
`create`, `update`, `runNow` and `delete`, which the sidecar exposes to the agent
as the tools of the `kiroshi` MCP server:

- the conversation and the bot come from the scope the session was opened with,
  never from the payload — a payload naming a field its operation does not
  declare is refused, that field named, and nothing is written;
- `list` answers every routine of that conversation, whatever bot owns one;
- `triggerSources` answers the sources that bot may be triggered by, each with
  the fields its events carry;
- `update`, `runNow` and `delete` refuse a routine of another conversation or of
  another bot, that routine named;
- every conversation is served the same way, a bot's own solo thread included:
  nothing here reads the kind of a conversation;
- every write emits `routine://changed` with the conversation id, whatever asked
  for it.

An `error` is a `RoutineError`, the same taxonomy the front's own invokes are
refused with. A session opened with no host attached answers every request with
one, so a request is never left hanging. So does the end of a session: a `close`
command, a `closed` frame, or an `open` reusing the same session key settles
every request that channel still awaits as `undeliverable`, since a host answer
has no deadline of its own.

## Stop and shutdown

- `interrupt` ends the turn with `result.subtype = "error_during_execution"` and
  **leaves the session usable**: a following prompt answers normally.
- `close` ends one session and nothing else — the sidecar serves the others.
- The host's exit is the only thing that ends the process: close stdin →
  `SIGTERM` → `SIGKILL`, on the whole group. The sidecar spawns real
  grandchildren (the agent, its MCP servers), so the group kill is what keeps
  orphans off the machine.

## What is deliberately not forwarded

The sidecar's stderr is read so the pipe never fills and then discarded unread —
it is the one channel that could carry an environment value. The sign-in probe
returns an email, an org id, an org name and a subscription type; the provider
module reduces it to one boolean before it reaches the pipe, so the host never
holds any of the rest. Search locations are reported as labels
(`$KIROSHI_AGENT_SIDECAR`, the app's own directory) rather than raw environment
values, and `redact` collapses the home directory out of every path *and* every
shell command before it crosses to React. There is no logging statement anywhere
in the module.
