It asks nothing — the title names what did not happen and the description says what the reader still has, which is the sentence a reader needs before deciding whether to press again. Both strings belong to the caller; the dialog holds no copy of its own beyond its two labels. Focus lands on Try again, because a reader who opened this dialog came to retry, and Close sits before it so the way out is still the first thing the eye meets. `onRetry` fires once, both actions go quiet while it is in flight, and a rejection holds the dialog on the same description instead of closing on a press that changed nothing.",
