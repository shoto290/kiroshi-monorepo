					"The frame a message wears when it answers another one: the quoted author with the first line of what they wrote, above whatever the frame is given to hold — a bubble in the transcript, the composer in `AI/PromptReply`. It takes the fill of the side it quotes, not its own: `from` is who wrote the quoted message, so answering the reader wears the reader's fill and answering a companion wears the companion's. A tenth of the background is laid over that fill, which is what keeps the quote readable as a separate surface from the bubble sitting in it even when both sides are the same. Resolving an id to an author and an excerpt is the screen's business, never this frame's, and pressing the quote reports a jump the host performs. The excerpt is always one line: a longer one is clipped rather than allowed to grow what it wraps. `trailing` takes one control beside the quote — the composer puts its dismiss there. Given no quote it keeps the same two elements around what it holds and drops every mark of its own, so a host that wraps something long-lived can leave the frame mounted and let only the quote come and go.",
