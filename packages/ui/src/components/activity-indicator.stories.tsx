The label is always on the screen, shimmering while the companion works, so nothing has to be pointed at to be read; a busy row given a `startedAt` instant counts up from it every second, and a row without one shows the label alone. The avatar is also the stop control — given `stoppable`, pointing at it or reaching it by keyboard covers the animal with a stop glyph, so the composer below stays free for the next prompt. A waiting row carries neither shimmer nor clock: `waitingOn` says whether the companion is waiting for the reader or queued for the next wave. The kind comes from the running tool, so reading turns the avatar to `searching` and a shell command to `working`. Nothing here polls the transport; a screen maps its own state onto `kind` and `label`. Inside a transcript the avatar is understood to be the same mark the `AssistantTurn` gutter shows once the turn lands, so it travels there rather than being replaced — give both rows the same `botId` and it does, within that one conversation. See `Mark`, `MarkPerBot` for a room where several companions are busy at once, and `ConversationChange` for what a swapped conversation does to them.",
