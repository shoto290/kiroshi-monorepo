					"The control that says which space a reader is in and moves them to another one. On an open panel it is a ghost button carrying the space's name alone, sized to sit on a header line beside a trailing icon button; on the icon rail the name goes and the space's tint takes its place as a dot, which is all a rail has room for. Pressing it opens a single-choice menu: every space with its tint and its rank as a Cmd shortcut hint, then an item to create one, then an item to open the space settings. `SpaceDots` is its companion for a pinned strip — one dot per space, the open one filled with its tint and larger, the rest muted and smaller, so the reader knows how many spaces exist and where they stand without opening anything. Both take the same props, so a host maps its store onto `spaces` and `selectedSpaceId` once and hands the pair the same callbacks — including `onReorderSpaces`, since the order is the reader's to set: a dot is dragged to the place its space should hold, and the menu's `Move up` and `Move down` do the same move without a pointer. That order is not decoration — it is which space each `⌘1`…`⌘9` reaches and the order a swipe walks — so it is reported whole, as the full list of ids, and never applied here. A single space still shows the button, since creating a second one lives in its menu, but draws no dots — there is nothing to count. Reach for this at the top of a sidebar; `AppSidebar` mounts both and adds the swipe and the Cmd+digit chords that go with them.",

Check the pair acts on the space the button names and moves it one place at a time in the list above them, that `Move up` is dead while that space stands first and `Move down` while it stands last — an item that reads as an offer and does nothing is worse than an item that says it cannot — and that the dots redraw in the new order the moment the host takes it.
