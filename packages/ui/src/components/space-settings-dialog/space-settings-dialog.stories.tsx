Below a separator sits the danger zone, set apart in destructive tone exactly as a companion's settings sets it apart, because a space takes its companions with it. It opens on the space every time. Same contract as a companion's settings and for the same reason: fully controlled, saving as you type, no draft, no debounce — closing it is never a question, except while a skill or a connector is half written.",
