It states what leaves before the reader presses anything, then names the thing again in the confirmation, so a reader who opened the wrong settings finds out there rather than after. The destructive tone is carried by a hairline border rather than a fill, so the group reads as serious without shouting over the panel above it. It carries no copy of its own: the heading, the sentence and the confirmation title all arrive as props, which is what lets one group serve every panel. The question is its own — the group opens and closes it, and `onDelete` fires only on the second press. The destructive red on its own tint is the token's known contrast gap, flagged for review rather than worked around here.",
