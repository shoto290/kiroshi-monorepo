					"The label a control earns only once it is pointed at or focused. It clones its single child to listen for hover and focus, then draws the bubble in a portal at fixed viewport coordinates, so it escapes every ancestor's overflow and stacking context and stays pinned while the page scrolls. It describes, it never names: an icon-only control still needs its own `aria-label`, and the tooltip is wired as `aria-describedby` only while it is on screen. Hover-capable pointers only — a tap would leave it stuck open — and under reduced motion it fades in place instead of spawning. Reach for `Button`'s `tooltip` prop rather than this directly wherever the trigger is a button.",
