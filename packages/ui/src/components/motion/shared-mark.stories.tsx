					"The box a travelling mark occupies. Give the same `markId` to two places a mark can live and Motion moves it between them rather than letting it disappear from one and reappear in the other. Two rules make that work, and both are load-bearing: exactly one node may hold a given id at a time — the places must be mutually exclusive, never two rows of one list — and the box measures the same wherever it lands, which is why it is a block box rather than an inline one. An id is a name rather than a handle: hand the slot another one and it draws another mark, which lands where it belongs instead of travelling from where the first one stood — this is how a chat swapped to another conversation keeps its marks at home. Without an id it is a plain span with nothing to travel to, and pays nothing for the possibility. `AI/Turn → Mark` shows it carrying the bot's avatar across a real transcript.",
