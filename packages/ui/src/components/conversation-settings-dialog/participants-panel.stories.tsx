Moving the crown is a press on another row's crown; dismissing is the cross beside it. The panel owns nothing but the search string: every press is reported up, so the screen decides what a dismissal or a handover means. Two rules are enforced here rather than upstream — the last companion seated cannot be dismissed, and a companion already seated is never offered again, so the roster below only ever shows companions that can actually be recruited. Reach for `BotPicker` for that roster on its own, and for `ConversationSettingsDialog` for the panel in its rail.",
