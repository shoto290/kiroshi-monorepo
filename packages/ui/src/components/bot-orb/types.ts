 * The nine shipped states — each a hand-tuned animation:
 * - `working`    — particles on tilted orbits
 * - `searching`  — a scan meridian sweeps a dotted globe
 * - `solving`    — bands scramble in quarter turns, then click back
 * - `listening`  — a waveform rolls through latitude rings
 * - `connecting` — a constellation wires itself, packets running the edges
 * - `weaving`    — three strands plait around the sphere
 * - `composing`  — an undulating multi-band sash
 * - `breathing`  — a face-on ring slowly morphing
 * - `shaping`    — a dotted outline morphs circle → triangle → square

 *      `MutationObserver`;

 *      subscribed for live OS/browser theme switches;
 *   3. during SSR (no DOM) the first client render resolves the theme
 *      before anything is painted — the canvas is client-only.
 * - `dark` / `light` pin the palette regardless of context.
 *
 * Dark renders light ink on the transparent canvas (for dark
 * backgrounds); light renders dark ink (for light backgrounds).
