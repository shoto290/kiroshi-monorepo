So the kind is carried by shape and never by a word: a companion floats free, a room is held in a container. The frame takes the same square a companion avatar takes, so nothing in the column moves between the two kinds; only what fills the square changes. Up to three companions are drawn; past three the fourth cell of the grid, free by construction, holds how many were left out. It draws and nothing else — no name, no layout — and a room within its three faces is hidden from a screen reader, because three avatar labels in front of a room name bury the name. A room that overflows is the one exception: it announces its count as the label of the square, since nothing else in the row says it.",
