Escape, a press on the backdrop and the corner affordance all close it. The surface caps at the window minus 3rem in both directions and scrolls what does not fit, and a `className` on `Content` overrides its width and padding without touching that cap. Opening and closing fade and scale over 150ms, and drop to an instant swap under `prefers-reduced-motion`.",
