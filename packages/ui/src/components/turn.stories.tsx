					"The two transcript rows, one per side. `UserTurn` is a bubble that can offer a retry when the prompt never reached Claude, and that holds the wait for a prompt written while another turn runs — `queued` draws it a step back from a sent prompt, with its own way out; `AssistantTurn` is a bubble on the other side with a gutter for the bot's avatar. Only the bots are named here — the reader's side carries no avatar at all. A long answer arrives as a run of rows, one per paragraph: wrap those in `TurnGroup` and it tells each row where it sits, so nothing counts rows by hand, and pass `identity` on the row that closes the run — a row with no `identity` falls back to the `author` it closes its run with, and both draw the same bot avatar. A block that already draws its own frame — a table — takes `bare`, which drops the bubble behind it rather than boxing the same grid twice. `copyText` is per bubble and holds that bubble's own words — a row handed an empty one, as a turn that stopped before writing is, offers no copy at all. Both take the transport's completion verbatim as `state`, so a screen maps nothing. A row given `onReply` reveals a second action ahead of copy, and a row given `repliedTo` is wrapped in the quote of the message it answers — both report to the screen and neither knows what is being quoted. `messageId` anchors the row so the scroller can be asked to bring it back, and it is set once per message: a message split into a run puts it on the group instead of on every paragraph. `stoppable` comes in from the screen and turns the gutter avatar into the stop for that one bot, so a wave is ended one seat at a time; it is never read off `state`, since a turn can be read back as `streaming` from a crash and stop nothing, and a row the screen still holds a seat for carries its stop whatever state it landed in, and it is named and shaped after the very identity the gutter draws, since a stop named after another bot stops the wrong one. Neither scrolls or animates the list — that belongs to the scroller around them.",
