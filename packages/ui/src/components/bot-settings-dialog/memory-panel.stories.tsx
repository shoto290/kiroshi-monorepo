It sits under the instructions because the two read as one page and are told apart by their author: the instructions are what the user asks of the companion, the memory is what the companion noticed on its own. It is a draft rather than a live field — the companion keeps writing while it is open, so nothing is reported until the reader saves, and saving stays out of reach while the text is the one they were handed. Clearing is the other way out and asks its question first: the memory is written by a hand that is not in the room, so it is never wiped on a single press.",
