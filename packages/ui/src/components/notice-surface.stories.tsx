Both are module-level calls, so a controller, a driver or a scheduler raises a notice without a hook and without a component in scope. Notices land against the bottom inline-end edge, newest nearest that edge, three at most, with the ones beyond the limit marked `data-limited` rather than removed. Enter and leave fade and slide over 150ms, and drop to a fade with no movement under `prefers-reduced-motion`. `transientDelay` on the viewport overrides the delay for the whole surface; a failure ignores it.",
