It is the menu the roster row has always opened on a right-click, lifted out of that row so the same list can hang off any surface naming a companion — the roster row, the avatar in the transcript gutter, a mention inside a message. It is a `ContextMenuContent`, so it is given to a `ContextMenu` beside its trigger and never rendered on its own. The order is fixed: the pin toggle and its separator first, then Settings, Duplicate, the section branch, the spaces branch, and Delete apart at the bottom. Settings, Duplicate and Delete are always drawn — each calls the callback it was given and does nothing when it was given none. The three that answer to the host are the pin toggle, which needs `onPin` or `onUnpin` depending on `isPinned`, the section branch, which needs `onMoveToSection` or `onCreateSectionFor`, and the spaces branch, which needs `onAddToSpace` or `onRemoveFromSpace` plus spaces and memberships to list: each of those draws nothing at all without them. Outside the roster, `CompanionMenuProvider` is what hands this content to the transcript: it answers one companion id with one menu, and a surface it answers nothing for keeps the markup it had.",
