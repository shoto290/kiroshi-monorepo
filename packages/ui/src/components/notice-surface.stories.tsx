Both are module-level calls, so a controller, a driver or a scheduler raises a notice without a hook and without a component in scope, and both take an optional action drawn between the text and the close control. Both return the identifier of the notice they raised, and `endNotice` takes that identifier and takes the notice off screen; an identifier no notice on screen carries leaves the surface as it was. Notices land against the top edge, newest nearest it, three at most, with the ones beyond the limit marked `data-limited` rather than removed. Enter and leave travel through the top edge over 500ms, and drop to a fade with no movement under `prefers-reduced-motion` - see `ReducedMotion`. `transientDelay` on the viewport overrides the delay for the whole surface; a failure ignores it.",
