Reach for it wherever a press deletes: it dims the page and traps focus, so it reads as a question rather than as a notification, and it puts Cancel first so the safe way out is the one the hand reaches. The title names the thing, never the action alone — a reader who opened the wrong row finds out here rather than after — and the description repeats the consequence in full instead of shortening it to `Are you sure?`. It owns its own open state and reports nothing until the second press: `onConfirm` fires once, and a cancelled question is not news. The destructive red on its own tint is the token's known contrast gap, flagged for review rather than worked around here.",
