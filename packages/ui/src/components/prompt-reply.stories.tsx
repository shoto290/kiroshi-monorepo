Its corner is the composer's own plus the padding around it, so the two curves stay concentric whether the composer is a pill or has grown into its expanded shape. It draws only — the host holds which message is being answered, writes the excerpt, moves the transcript when the quote is pressed and drops the frame when the cross is. `AI/MessageQuote` is the frame underneath it, `AI/Turn → Quoted` is the same frame around a bubble.",
