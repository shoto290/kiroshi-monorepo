It is a 32px ghost button in the window's title bar: the space's tint as a 10px swatch, its name in the muted 13px line, then a chevron that says it opens. Pressing it opens a single-choice menu: every space with its tint and its rank as a Cmd shortcut hint, then an item to create one, then an item to open the space settings. `SpaceDots` is its companion for a pinned strip, one dot per space, the open one filled with its tint and larger, the rest muted and smaller, so the reader knows how many spaces exist and where they stand without opening anything. Both take the same props, so a host maps its store onto `spaces` and `selectedSpaceId` once and hands the pair the same callbacks, including `onReorderSpaces`, since the order is the reader's to set: a dot is dragged to the place its space should hold, and the menu's `Move up` and `Move down` do the same move without a pointer. That order is not decoration, it is which space each `⌘1`…`⌘9` reaches and the order a swipe walks, so it is reported whole, as the full list of ids, and never applied here. A single space still shows the button, since creating a second one lives in its menu, but draws no dots, there is nothing to count.
